- New html knowledge:
    - [Audio tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp):
        - The audio tag is used to `embed sound content` in a `document`, such as music or other audio streams.
        - Can `contains` `one or more audio tag` with different audio source.
        - The text between `audio` and `/audio` tag will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the `audio` element.
        - Supported audio formats in HTML: `MP3`, `WAV`, and `OGG`.
    - With audio tag:
        - Use .play if you want to play a tag.
        - Use .pause if you want to pause.
        - Use .currentTime = 0 if you want to back at 0 second.
    - If you want to create new element, just use **document.Element**
